						<p class="paragraph">Deeply psychological or adept salesman? The work of Yves Klein continues to inspire debate well after his death. Subject to that debate is the psychology behind Klein's work, in particular. Some, including Pierre Restany, argue for an image of Klein as a deeply spiritual man, influence by his Rosicrucian beliefs and the philosophy of Bachelard. Others view Klein's work from the lens of the political economy and of commodification, particularly Thierry De Duve and Benjamin H. D. Buchloh. Klein's work, however, transcends this; although mysticism exists widely throughout his work, Klein, knowingly or unknowingly, positioned his work as commodity through his avant-garde gestures.
</p>

						<p class="paragraph">Pierre Restany, an art critic known for his involvement in the formation of the Nouveaux Réalistes, details the spirituality and semiology within Klein's artistic practice and presents Bachelardian philosophy and Rosicrucian beliefs as influences through various periods in Klein's career, as well as modes of interpretation into his artistic practice and psychology. Particularly, he focuses on situating the common thread of fire within Klein's work and asserting it as the culmination of Klein's quest for the immaterial; "beyond the fire lies the Immaterial."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Klein's blue-gold-pink trilogy then become the flame of fire, the fire of God, a sort of "chromatic trinity" according to Restany. In Klein's Ex-Voto dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia. 1961 Fig. 1, the chromatic trinity in combination serves as a reliquary to Saint Rita, the "controlling symbol of God's calling over immaterial, pictorial sensibility." For Klein, his veneration of Saint Rita, a patron saint of lost causes, represents that which separates him from God and the immaterial, or rather his path to success and validation. Containing three sections of pigment, his trademark International Klein Blue, IKB, pink, and gold leaf, his ex-voto is like a small offering to Saint Rita ensuring future protection and success.  For Klein, "Thus fire is a human reality as well as a cosmic state. Where The Void is found there also lies fire. Blue is fire, gold is fire, rose is fire as well. Standing between the blue and the fire I know now that essentially I am a realist of today and yesterday, as well as tomorrow." The chromatic trinity symbolize then the result of the fire of God (through gold), "Madder rose represents the Holy Spirit before the gold of the Father and the blue of the Son; gold for immortality and blue for sensibility."<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">1</a></sup> For Klein, his veneration of Saint Rita, a patron saint of lost causes, represents that which separates him from God and the immaterial, or rather his path to success and validation.

						<p class="paragraph">Ex-Voto dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia and Klein’s intentions behind it are presented as more self-serving and laughable in Thierry De Duve’s essay, Yves Klein, or the Dead Dealer. De Duve, art critic and professor at Hunter College, details Klein’s work as commodity, viewed from a Marxist perspective of the political economy. Going beyond psychology and into economics, he asserts that Klein constructs a congruence between the aesthetic field and that of the political economy through the assimilation of artistic value to exchange-value. De Duve presents creativity as myth and posits that the systematic repetition of Klein’s work allowed the transformation of creativity to labor power. Klein presents his work as owner and artist, rather than skilled technician and with that, he is the sole producer of this exchange-value furthering the value and conflating the price. Through this De Duve asserts that Klein “lets this be understood … by denying originality, by inviting accusations of fraudulence.”<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">1</a></sup> Ex-Voto dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia is then presented as “humility failing to disguise its naïve arrogance.” De Duve presents the kettle-argument in explaining the false sincerity of Klein’s prayer; despite the humility suggested in the opening of the prayer, Klein ends with an almost arrogant request “That my exhibition at Krefeld may be the greatest success of the century and be recognized by all.” Klein in all of his sincerity has the incredible quality of making others doubt his sincerity. His mysticism is either a result of great attempts to appear that way or that he himself truly believes and lives it to the point of credulity. Either way, Klein has a way of validating and defending his work against critical analysis; through multiple interpretations of his work, Klein builds a defense. It is within multiple interpretations, that Klein positions himself as sole producer and therefore allowed to integrate the pictorial quality with exchange-value. In his repetition and subsequent commodification, he rejects originality and allows creativity (specifically his own “creativity”) to become labor power. Ex-Voto dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia in a way, then is a transaction. Even though there is no one present to witness the transaction. Saint Rita herself takes the on the role of one of “the representatives of art-as-commerce”. </p>

						<p class="paragraph">Klein’s work, however, requires a performative reading and interpretation to connect the elements of mysticism and commodification seen within his work. Kaira M. Cabañas, an art historian, argues that the performative appropriation of the “real” by the Nouveaux Réalistes positioned their works’ influence in creating discourse through their performative qualities. Specifically, Cabañas focuses on Klein’s work as commodification and appropriation of power. She presents Klein’s La spécialisation de la sensibilité à l’état matière première en sensibilité picturale stabilisée, Le Vide. 1958 Fig. 2, a production of a space that is encoded with power, “from commercial transactions to the presence of Republican Guards”, to suggest that the performative is a means of penetrating the “real”, through the visitors’ behavior to literally penetrating their bodies with blue dye from the cocktails served, to move consideration from the art object to the experience. In Ex-Voto dedicated to Saint Rita of Cascia, likewise, Klein is influenced by avant-garde gestures and the performative to create reliquary, an act to Saint Rita, that is encoded with humility and reverence, although its validity remains to be seen. Klein incorporates the gold from his immaterial transactions and a readymade Plexiglas box to create the ex-voto. In doing so, Klein creates commodity and in turn, transforms the role of Saint Rita within the transaction. Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, professor at Harvard University, argues for a dialectical approach to comparing the work of Yves Klein and Arman through the lens of their social and political context, exploring its contribution to the emergence of their work. Klein’s work denies the existence of predecessors so that the visual object can escape its historical basis in texture and material to become spectacle, creating a new aesthetic. Cabañas asserts that “Klein stages the limits of visual perception vis-à-vis color as commodity: International Klein Blue. … Klein not only rewrites the contingency of color perception as an arbitrary function of exchange but also insists on the viewer’s “instantaneous contemplation,” shifting his attention from the immanence of color perception to the immaterial transcendence of viewing” By doing so, Klein is able to successfully change ones understanding of color to that which one perceives, allowing him to begin the construction of his immaterial work. By separating pigment from painting, he separates it from its “material support” What Klein does here, then, is to create an art object without the indexical and the nominal quality of Duchamp’s influence, art of the immaterial and of pictorial sensibility. However, “in order to make his pictorial sensibility legible, Klein performs the index … the bodily gestures that often supplements the articulation of “this” or “that,” establishing a process of connection to an invisible referent.”</p>
						
						<p class="paragraph1">Decades after his death, Yves Klein continues to transcend critics and position his work within the realm of mysticism and commodity. Whether knowingly or unknowingly, Klein created an equivalence between that of the aesthetic field and of the political economy that continues to have reverberations and ramifications throughout the art world. Inspired by the work of Bachelard and his Rosicrucian beliefs, Klein synthesized mysticism and art to create an altogether all new reality, that of the immaterial.</p>
