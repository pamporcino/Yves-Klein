# Yves-Klein
My Art Paper

Deeply psychological or adept salesman? The work of Yves Klein continues to inspire debate well after his death. Subject to that debate is the psychology behind Klein's work, in particular. Some, including Pierre Restany, argue for an image of Klein as a deeply spiritual man, influence by his Rosicrucian beliefs and the philosophy of Bachelard. Others view Klein's work from the lens of the political economy and of commodification, particularly Thierry De Duve and Benjamin H. D. Buchloh. Klein's work, however, transcends this; although mysticism exists widely throughout his work, Klein, knowingly or unknowingly, positioned his work as commodity through his avant-garde gestures.

This project is the final result of my research on Yves Klein and psychology behind his work.
